  <h1>Road to success</h1>
  <p>How do you define success in life? Most people consider success as having a great career,
  wealth, and respect from peers. But, don’t overlook goals that will support a happier life.
  Prioritizing relationships, physical health, safety, contributing to others, and creative
  expression have been shown to improve feelings of happiness.</p>
  <p>However, don’t confuse the feeling of happiness with success. You could be quite happy eating
  Cheetos in your parents’ basement while you watch TV. That doesn’t make you a success.
  As Eleanor Roosevelt said, “Happiness is not a goal…it’s a by-product of a life well-lived.” </p>
  <p><b>Success in life means attaining your vision of a good life. It means achieving specific
  goals that result in the future you have planned for yourself. Success in life is defined by
  the individual. Your vision of success looks different than someone else’s.</b></p>
  <p>If you are looking for the key to success in business vs the key to success in a relationship,
  your strategies and efforts are going to be quite different.</p>
  <p>It’s also important to take care that you don’t let someone else dictate what a successful life for
  you looks like. You only have so much time in life, so make sure you create a holistic picture
  for yourself.</p>
